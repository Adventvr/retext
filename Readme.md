**retext** is a extensible natural language parser system‚Äîby default using [parse-english](https://github.com/wooorm/parse-english) as a parser and [textom](https://github.com/wooorm/textom/) as the object model. Provides a plugin-system for analysing and manipulating natural language. In JavaScript. NodeJS, and the browser. Tests provide 100% coverage.

## Usage

```js
var Retext = require('retext'),
    emoji = require('retext-emoji'),
    smartypants = require('retext-smartypants'),
    input;

// Modified first paragraph from: 
//   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_wise_monkeys
input = 'The three wise monkeys [. . .] sometimes called the ' +
        'three mystic apes--are a pictorial maxim. Together ' +
        'they embody the proverbial principle to ("see no evil, ' +
        'hear no evil, speak no evil"). The three monkeys are ' +
        'Mizaru (:see_no_evil:), covering his eyes, who sees no ' +
        'evil; Kikazaru (:hear_no_evil:), covering his ears, ' +
        'who hears no evil; and Iwazaru (:speak_no_evil:), ' +
        'covering his mouth, who speaks no evil.'

var text = new Retext()
  .use(emoji({
      'convert' : 'encode'
  }))
  .use(smartypants())
  .parse(input)
  .toString();
// The three wise monkeys [‚Ä¶] sometimes called the three

## API

### Retext(parser)

Return a new `Retext` instance with the given parser.

Takes a parser (Object, String, or null), or its name to use. Defaults to `"parse-english"`. When a string, requires the module.

### Retext.prototype.use(plugin)

Attaches a plugin. Returns self.

Takes a plugin‚Äîa humble function‚Äîand when the `parse` method of the Retext instance is called, the plugin will be called with the parsed tree, and the Retext instance as arguments. Plugins can also have an `attach` method, which will be only called once (when the plugin is `use`d).

### Retext.prototype.parse(source)

Parses the given source (using the to the constructor given parser), and returns the‚Äîby `use`d plugins, modified‚Äîtree.

Note that, during the parsing stage, when the `use` method is called by a plugin, the nested plugin is immediately called, before continuing on with its parent plugin‚Äîthis enabled plugins to depend on other plugins.

Returns a RootNode.
